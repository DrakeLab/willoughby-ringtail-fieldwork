### Background: 

Human activities modify the abundance and distribution of resources in wild landscapes. As a result, animals alter their ranging behavior, aggregation, diet, and interactions with other wildlife species. These within-host and population-level changes can influence the dynamics of infectious diseases. In nature reserves, visitors have a unique interface with wildlife and often provide new resources through direct feeding or access to campsite food. While these conservation areas offer wildlife refuge from further habitat degradation due to urbanization or agriculture, increases in human visitation subvert natural resources and facilitate animal habituation.

Visitors continue to feed park wildlife despite discouraging signage. Supplemental resources might improve food access temporarily, but nutritional quality can be low. Consequently, a diet high in human food could decrease immune defenses and slow recovery from infection. Competition for human-provided food could heighten aggression and constrict foraging ranges, leading to increased contact between individuals that may facilitate pathogen transmission. Further, park use by visitors is often highly seasonal and spatially variable, causing variation in wildlife populations' use of natural and human food3. We are interested in how human-provided resources may facilitate the habituation of nuisance animals, dampen natural resource-scarcity mitigation strategies, and increase parasite sharing across species while increasing human infection risk. Parks and nature reserves, therefore, are well suited to exploring mechanisms associated with tourist activity on wildlife food webs and parasite diversity.

### Research questions:
1. How do visitor-provided resources affect wildlife behavior? 
2. How do visitor-provided resources affect wildlife diet? 
3. How do visitor-provided resources affect wildlife condition (e.g. immunity)? 
4. How do visitor-provided resources affect wildlife infection status and parasites?
